# Multi-Chain NFT Marketplace and Digital Currency Exchange

## Overview

Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) have revolutionized the concept of digital assets by representing unique and non-replicable items like digital art, collectibles, and virtual items. This paper discusses the development of an NFT marketplace with multi-chain support, enabling the trading of NFTs using various cryptocurrencies and improving user flexibility. The proposed platform leverages the power of liquidity, integration with services like Metamask, and the ThirdWeb framework for NFT creation.

- **Authentication with Metamask:** Enhanced security and ease of use with Metamask integration for wallet management and transaction signing.
- **ThirdWeb NFT Creation:** Utilizing ThirdWeb to create and ship NFT collections without manual coding.
- **Infura Integration:** Deploying blockchain applications at scale with easy access to Ethereum and IPFS through Infura.
- **Cranq IDE:** Using Cranq, a low-code IDE, for efficient component authoring and code reusability.
- **Sanity Database:** Utilizing the Sanity open-source single-page application for managing NFT data and images.
- **Next.js Framework:** Developing web applications with Next.js, adding features like static site generation and server-side rendering.
- **Vercel Deployment:** Deploying web applications on Vercel for building, testing, and hosting web projects.
